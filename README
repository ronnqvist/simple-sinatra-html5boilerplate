This is just a plain HTML5 Boilerplate setup for Sinatra using HAML and SASS, without converting the actual HTML5 Boilerplate into that (for easy upgrading to future versions).

The HTML5 Boilerplate was placed into the public-directory, the index.html moved to views/layout.erb with a little erb added to it. The standard style.css was just moved into views/stylesheets/style.scss without any modifications done to it.
